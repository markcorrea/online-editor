# Online Editor

The online version can be seen here: https://onlineeditor.netlify.app

Online Editor is a test designed to see the qualifications of a candidate for a React Front End Engineer at Veezo. It is a code editor which should allow the user to list the available files in a tree format, load the contents of a chosen file, edit its content and save it. Also, the user should be able to delete a file. Below you can see specific details about installation, requirements, and features.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
- In order to run this project, you need NodeJS version 12 or higher. I used `v12.13.0`.
- Clone the project to your machine (link above). 
- Open Terminal and `cd` to the root of the project.
- Run `npm ci` (yes, `ci`. Not `npm install`).
- Once `npm ci` finishes, run `npm start`.

## ðŸš€ How to use
As soon as the page is loaded (or you click the link above), the main page will show you a menu on the left side and an empty screen on the right side. The menu will take a second and then load the Tree of folders and files. You can expand the folders and, when clicking a file, it will be loaded on the empty screen inside an editor.

### ðŸ“„ Editing files
At the moment, once we have only files in `Java`, the editor only edits this type of file. That can be easily improved in the future. In the header, an option will be displayed to `Delete` the current file. 
The editor executes all basic functionalities, such as identation, color distinction, autocomplete. Once you change the file, two more options will be displayed in the header: `Discard Changes`, and `Save`. Have in mind that, before you change to another file, you have to save or discard the changes you made in the current one.

### :last_quarter_moon: Dark Mode
For protection of your eyes, `Online Editor` allows you to switch between `Dark` and `Light` themes. Above the `Files` tree in the Side Menu, there is a switch where you can switch it anytime.

### :iphone: Mobile
Nonetheless, you can use the `Online Editor` on a mobile device. It is totally responsive, and even in your cellphone it is possible to work on those files. When you load the app, you will see a `list icon` in the header. Click on it and the `Side Menu` will slide in.
